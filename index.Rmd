Hello and welcome.  

You'll be seeing a lot images and gif files (on a fast and endless mind-disturbing loop - my bad) illustrating how to use IBM SPSS to run mixed models. These images and gifs refer to IBM SPSS version 25. Different SPSS versions may show different dialog boxes. I don’t expect these differences to be very dramatic, but even if they are, with a bit of patience you’ll make SPSS do whatever you want. Remember: computers are stupid machines that just do what you tell them to do!
